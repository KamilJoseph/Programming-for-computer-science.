Develop series of mini applications. 

Creating a top level menu system allows user to select the menue system which of the mini applications to run when its launched. 
If the user presses a number that is not selected on the list then a message should be displayed. Once the applications has 
finished the menu should be displayed and user should be asked what applications to run next.

1) Keep Counting Game
2) Check-digit calculator
3) Check digit generator
4) Quit

### Mini App 1: Keep Counting Game

Starts from two random numbers, the user is presented with 10 different questions additions or subtractions.
The answer to the previous questions becomes the first operand of the next question. The type of questions could 
either be plus or minus and the second operand to the next question is randomly generated. Assuming that user enters
valid input for data types. The game is timed however, the player needs to correctly answer all. 
As soon as a player gets a wrong answer the answer is displayed and the game stops.
E.g.
Question 1: 9 - 6 = 
3
Question 2: 3 + 3 = 
6

### Mini App 2: Check-digit calculator
Input a single 5 digit number from the user 
The application will create a 6th check digit using the rules outlined below. 
This check-digit is appended to the original input and displayed as a 6-digit code.  For example, the user input “12345” number will become “12345?” with the ‘?’ indicating the check digit. All individual digits of input must be in the range of 1 and 9 inclusive, else an error message is displayed to the user, and they are asked to input again
Check that the input number is valid, else display an error message and ask the user to enter again


### Mini App 3: Check digit chacker
Provide a check-digit checker that allows the user to enter a 6-digit code and validate the check digit for correctness using the rules outlined in the generator for mini-app 3
